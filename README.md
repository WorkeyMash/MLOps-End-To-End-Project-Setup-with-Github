## Project Overview

This repository contains all the necessary components to build, train, and deploy a machine learning model in a production environment. It covers the following aspects:

- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)
- Version control with GitHub

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Docker
- Git
- GitHub Actions
- Flask (for model serving)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MLOps-End-To-End-Project-Setup-with-Github.git
   cd MLOps-End-To-End-Project-Setup-with-Github
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

```

## Getting Started

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/raw/` directory.
2. Modify the configuration files in the `src/` directory as needed.
3. Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for initial data exploration and model training.

## Usage

To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python src/models/train.py
```

To evaluate the model, use:

```bash
python src/evaluation/evaluate.py
```

To serve the model using Flask, execute:

```bash
python src/deployment/app.py
```
